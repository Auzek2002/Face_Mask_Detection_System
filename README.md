# Face Mask Detection System:
In this notebook, I've developed a model using the VGG16 architecture to accurately detect whether a person is wearing a face mask. By adding custom layers on top of VGG16, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of around 95%. This system finds application in healthcare settings where it is crucial for individuals to wear face masks for safety and hygiene purposes.
